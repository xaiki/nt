2. [x] **Tokio Test**
   - [x] For async/await testing
   - [x] Provides `#[tokio::test]` attribute
   - [x] Handles async runtime setup

3. [ ] **Criterion** (Planned)
   - [ ] For benchmarking and performance testing
   - [ ] Provides statistical analysis of performance
   - [ ] Helps identify performance regressions

### Additional Testing Tools (Planned)

1. [ ] **Mockall**
   - [ ] For creating mock objects
   - [ ] Useful for testing components with external dependencies
   - [ ] Provides automatic mock generation

2. [ ] **Proptest**
   - [ ] For property-based testing
   - [ ] Generates random inputs to test properties
   - [ ] Helps find edge cases

3. [ ] **Rustdoc Tests**
   - [ ] For documentation testing
   - [ ] Ensures code examples in documentation are valid
   - [ ] Provides `#![doc(test(attr(...)))]` for custom test attributes

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests

#### Location
- Tests live alongside the code they test
- Each module has its own `#[cfg(test)]` section
- Tests are in the same file as the code they test

#### Coverage
- Test all public APIs
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Test internal helper functions where appropriate
- Aim for 100% line coverage of critical paths

#### Best Practices
- One assertion per test where possible
- Clear test names that describe the test case
- Use `#[should_panic]` for expected failures
- Document test cases with comments

### 2. Integration Tests

#### Location
- In `tests/` directory at crate root
- Separate from unit tests
- Can use the crate as a dependency

#### Coverage
- Test component interactions
- Test end-to-end functionality
- Test error propagation
- Test concurrent behavior

#### Best Practices
- Use `#[test]` for synchronous tests
- Use `#[tokio::test]` for async tests
- Clear test organization by feature
- Shared test utilities in `tests/common.rs`

### 3. Performance Tests

#### Location
- In `benches/` directory
- Using Criterion framework

#### Coverage
- Critical path performance
- Memory usage
- Concurrent operation performance
- Resource utilization

#### Best Practices
- Compare against baseline
- Document performance characteristics
- Test under different loads
- Monitor for regressions

## Next Steps

1. **Short Term**
   - Implement `window_with_title.rs` tests
   - Add missing edge case tests
   - Add error handling tests
   - Set up basic CI pipeline

2. **Medium Term**
   - Set up performance testing infrastructure
   - Implement property-based tests
   - Add mock-based tests
   - Expand integration test coverage

3. **Long Term**
   - Implement end-to-end tests
   - Set up comprehensive CI/CD pipeline
   - Add performance regression testing
   - Implement documentation tests

## Conclusion

The current test implementation provides a solid foundation for basic functionality testing. The focus should be on:
1. Completing the missing unit tests
2. Adding performance testing infrastructure
3. Expanding integration test coverage
4. Setting up comprehensive CI/CD

The strategy will evolve as the project grows, but these core principles will guide our testing efforts.
