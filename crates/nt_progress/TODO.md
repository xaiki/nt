## Architectural Design Notes

### Capability System Design
The capability system has been simplified to use direct trait downcasting instead of a complex registry approach. This provides better type safety and simpler code while maintaining the same functionality.

### Mode Factory Design
The mode factory has been implemented using dependency injection, allowing for better testability and flexibility. Each mode is created through a factory function that takes standardized parameters and returns a boxed mode trait object.

### Parameter Standardization
Mode parameters have been standardized using the `ModeParameters` struct, which provides:
- Consistent parameter passing across all modes
- Built-in validation for required parameters
- Support for optional parameters with defaults
- Builder pattern for easy parameter construction
- Comprehensive error handling for invalid parameters

## Development Guidelines

- Avoid introducing new linter errors
- Minimize warnings
- Avoid code duplication
- Maintain test coverage
- Keep documentation updated
- Use descriptive commit messages
