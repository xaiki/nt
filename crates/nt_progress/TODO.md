# NT Progress Enhancements and TODO

## Overview and Current State

The `nt_progress` library provides a flexible and thread-safe progress display for Rust applications, featuring concurrent progress tracking, terminal-aware display, and customizable output modes.

### Completed Tasks

#### Base Structure Refactoring
- [x] Create a `WindowBase` struct that serves as a base class for Window and WindowWithTitle
- [x] Refactor `Window` to use WindowBase for shared functionality
- [x] Refactor `WindowWithTitle` to use WindowBase for shared functionality
- [x] Create a `SingleLineBase` struct that serves as a base for Limited and Capturing modes
- [x] Refactor Limited mode to use SingleLineBase
- [x] Refactor Capturing mode to use SingleLineBase

#### Core Architecture
- [x] Create a `JobTracker` trait to handle job counting consistency across implementations
- [x] Enhance BaseConfig for better reuse across different modes
- [x] Standardize method signatures
- [x] Create a TestBuilder utility to simplify test creation
- [x] Add standard testing utilities for common mode assertions
- [x] Standardize Thread Configuration implementation patterns
- [x] Create consistent method documentation

#### Thread Configuration Interface
- [x] Define minimal trait interface for ThreadConfig
- [x] Create wrapper struct `Config` for mode implementations
- [x] Implement Clone via `clone_box`
- [x] Add delegation methods to underlying implementation

#### Mode Implementations
- [x] Implement basic LimitedConfig with ThreadConfig trait
- [x] Implement basic CapturingConfig with ThreadConfig trait
- [x] Implement basic WindowConfig with ThreadConfig trait
- [x] Implement basic WindowWithTitleConfig with ThreadConfig trait

#### Documentation
- [x] Add documentation for existing modes
- [x] Document common patterns for implementing new modes
- [x] Create a README.md in the modes directory explaining the system design
- [x] Document standard patterns for implementing new modes
- [x] Provide example code for custom mode implementation
- [x] Document feature sets for each mode
- [x] Provide usage examples for each mode

## Remaining Tasks

### Error Handling and Robustness
- [ ] Implement a better error handling mechanism for mode creation
- [ ] Add detailed error types
- [ ] Implement error recovery strategies
- [ ] Add context-aware logging for debugging

### Unimplemented Features
- [x] Implement WindowWithTitle mode functionality (`set_title` method in ProgressDisplay)
- [ ] Implement total jobs support (`set_total_jobs` method in ProgressDisplay)
- [ ] Add emoji support (`add_emoji` method in ProgressDisplay)
- [ ] Implement direct writer functionality for TaskHandle (currently unused `writer` field)
- [ ] Implement output passthrough functionality (currently unused `passthrough` field and `has_passthrough` method in SingleLineBase)
- [ ] Standardize thread config creation (replace Config::new with more robust `create_thread_config` function)
- [ ] Add terminal size customization in TestBuilder (currently unused `width` and `height` fields)

### Optimization Opportunities
- [ ] Reduce duplication in string handling
- [ ] Consider memory usage optimizations in window handling
- [x] Fix unused mutable variables in tests
- [ ] Implement message batching
- [ ] Optimize buffer operations
- [ ] Consider message compression for high-volume scenarios

### Display Features
- [ ] Add color support for highlighting
- [ ] Implement line wrapping for long messages
- [ ] Add custom progress indicators
- [ ] Implement interactive progress bars
- [ ] Support ANSI escape sequences for advanced terminal operations

### Terminal Handling
- [ ] Move terminal size adjustment to separate module
- [ ] Add terminal size change detection
- [ ] Implement automatic terminal resize handling
- [ ] Fix failing terminal tests

### Testing Improvements
- [ ] Add more extensive unit tests for each mode
- [ ] Add integration tests for mode switching
- [ ] Improve tests for terminal size changes
- [ ] Add stress tests for concurrent usage
- [ ] Add tests for error handling and recovery

### Documentation Improvements
- [ ] Add examples for typical use cases
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Document thread safety guarantees
- [ ] Add examples for mode switching
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect latest features

## Implementation Priority

1. Fix warnings and linter issues
