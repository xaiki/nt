refactor: clean up dead code and implement missing functionality

- Implement render_conditional_tag in formatter.rs
  - Add support for {?condition} and {!condition} tags
  - Handle truthy/falsy conditions properly
  - Return appropriate string based on condition result

- Remove unused _mode parameter from start_display_thread
  - Parameter was not being used in the function
  - Clean up function signature for better clarity

- Keep Terminal struct fields for future features
  - Fields are placeholders for upcoming terminal capabilities
  - Will be used in Phase 2: Terminal Module Refactoring
  - No need to remove as they are part of the planned development

All tests passing with no regressions.
