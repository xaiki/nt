fix(core): Fix retry limit handling in BaseConfig and remove dead code

- Fixed retry limits by resetting the retry counter when a job is marked as completed
- Removed unused start_time_secs field from BaseConfig
- Fixed all tests related to retry limits and job status tracking
- Ensured retry limits are correctly enforced and reset appropriately
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with v0.1.36 release notes
- Bump version from 0.1.35 to 0.1.36

This change addresses an issue with retry limits where the retry count was not being reset when a job was marked as completed. The fix ensures that retry limits are properly enforced and reset when a job finishes, matching the behavior in the mark_succeeded method. It also removes an unused field that was generating a compiler warning.
